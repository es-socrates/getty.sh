## ==λ v1.0.1:== Widget Refactoring and Major Improvements

Hello everyone! We are excited to present version 1.0.1, which brings a series of significant improvements to widgets, internationalization (i18n) fixes, prize display optimizations, and more. Below, we detail all the changes:

### Widget Refactoring:

1. Separation of widgets (OBS/browser) and unification of the display of giveaway winners.
2. Widgets are now clearly separated between those used in OBS and those in the frontend, improving organization.
3. The winner display has been unified to ensure consistency across different environments or applications.

### Fixes in rendering participants, prizes, and commands

1. Issues in the representation of participants and prizes have been resolved.
2. Commands are now rendered correctly, avoiding visual errors.

### Internationalization (i18n) and translatable labels

1. All labels are now fully translatable, making localization to different languages easier.
2. Optimization in language management (languageManager properly integrated).

### Legacy code and log cleanup

1. Obsolete code that was no longer needed has been removed.
2. Reduction of unnecessary logs for cleaner code.

### Improvements in persistence and UI

1. Data persistence has been optimized for greater reliability.
2. User interface improvements for a smoother experience.

### Version update in package.json

1. Version 1.0.1 ready for production!
2. All changes have been tested and are stable for deployment.

### Improved widget styles

1. Fixed broken links.
2. Optimized language handling.

### Stronger analytics and enhanced notifications

We’re excited to announce the release of **getty v1.1.2**. In our ongoing mission to provide the best tools to make your streams a success, this update focuses on **improving stability, refining the visual experience, and —most importantly— delivering clearer data and actionable insights about your live performance**.

We listened to your feedback and worked hard to polish details and ship meaningful upgrades, especially across **real-time analytics** and the **tip and achievement notification system**.

## More robust, more precise live analytics

Understanding your audience is key. That’s why we optimized and fixed our **Live Analytics** charts so they’re more reliable and easier to interpret.

- **Clearer time segments:** We resolved an issue that could delay closing segments in the chart, now capping them at 90 minutes. This gives you a more precise, real-time view of how your audience fluctuates during a live stream.
- **Flexible goal configuration:** You can now personalize and configure the **Peak Viewers badge** and the **daily hours goal** directly from the dashboard, tailoring metrics to your own targets.
- **Goal line in history:** To help you visualize your goals, we added a **new goal line to the stream history chart**, letting you see exactly when you surpassed expectations.

## Optimized tip and achievement notifications

We want every tip and unlocked achievement to be celebrated seamlessly. This release brings important improvements on that front:

- **More stable widgets:** The **Tip Goal** and **Tip Notification** widgets received significant upgrades to feel smoother and more reliable, ensuring your community never misses a moment of appreciation.
- **Separate custom audio storage:** Your **custom audio for tips and achievements now saves independently**. This avoids mix-ups and guarantees you sound exactly how you want for each notification type.
- **Perfect sync:** We applied fixes to keep tip notifications and chat messages fully in sync, removing mix-ups or delays — especially in multi-tenant mode.

## Other key improvements and fixes

Beyond the headline features, this update ships a long list of refinements that elevate the overall experience:

- **New events widget:** We added a **recent events widget** that you can use as a browser source in OBS — perfect for showcasing recent interactions with style.
- **Reorganized history panel:** We moved the “Settings” button to the header next to the “Activity” title for more intuitive navigation, and gave it a signature pink style.
- **Improved raffle system:** We fixed the “Clear all” button so it properly resets the state, wipes winner data, and stays in sync between the admin panel and widgets.
- **More resilient connections:** We shipped fixes for **automatic WebSocket reconnection** in the chat widget and audio notifications, keeping your chat connection active and stable.
- **More stable admin panel:** We solved a routing issue that incorrectly redirected to the dashboard when refreshing the page inside the status section.

## How to update

The update will roll out automatically to the online version. If you don’t see the changes right away, we recommend clearing your browser or app cache to make sure you’re on the latest version. If you’re running a localhost build, take a look at our docs to rebuild the app or re-import your exported configuration.

We’re deeply grateful to everyone who reports bugs and sends suggestions. Your feedback is what drives these improvements. We hope these tools help you create even more incredible live streams.

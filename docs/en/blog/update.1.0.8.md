## ==Î» v1.0.8:== We did it again!

Getty has outdone itself once again with ==version 1.0.8==, offering excellent solutions that will encourage anyone to live stream on Odysee, now with more real-time notifications.

This update not only improves on what you already knew, but also opens a whole new door: **automatically notify your Discord or Telegram channels when your broadcast goes "live"**. Imagine all your followers being instantly alerted that the show has started without you having to lift a finger - that's the power of integration at its best!

### Whatâ€™s new in the Integrations page?

In the Integrations section youâ€™ll find a fresh, friendly form that lets you configure everything needed so your notifications reach the right places:

- **Choose your destination:** Discord or Telegram, wherever your community is most active.
- **Customize the message:** Define title, description, thumbnail, and footer. Every field is designed so your announcement is visually appealing and consistent with your branding.
- **Save and done:** Once saved, the system waits for your channel to enter the "live" state. At that moment the notification fires automatically, ensuring no one misses the start of your stream.

::: note

If you prefer full control, you can also trigger the notification manually from the options. Itâ€™s completely optional, but useful for testing or when you want to add a personal touch right before going live.

### Stream history

In addition to instant notification, gettyâ€¯v1.0.8 introduces a ==live streaming history== that turns raw data into a complete strategic view. From the table you can see how many hours youâ€™ve been on air, total views received, accumulated and verifiable tips to your Arweave wallet, average viewers, and active days.

**All of it breaks down flexibly:** you can filter by day, week, or year and choose between line or bar chart views to spot trends instantly. The tool also lets you export the entire history for external analysis and import previous data, ensuring you never lose a single piece of your creator journey. With this panel, every streamer holds a realâ€‘metrics roadmap ready to fuel their next big leap.

### Other notable changes in getty v1.0.8

- **Revamped documentation:** Contribution Guide, Code of Conduct, and ROUTES.md synced so collaborating is easier than ever.
- **Visual improvements:** New badge emojis, clearer activity panels, and perâ€‘module uptime charts showing realâ€‘time availability of each component.
- **Performance & stability:** Default avatar fixes, timezone adjustments in daily buckets, and a definitive solution to avoid closing sockets still connected.
- **Reinforced security:** Removal of inline onerror and exposure of environmentâ€‘specific CSP configuration, plus partial IP anonymization in logs.
- **New debugging tools:** Detailed logs in the hosted poller and endpoint diagnostics that make issue detection easier.

All this is complemented by small but valuable details: improvements to the chat container, new themes (including the elegant "X" theme) and a number of small fixes that make the experience smoother and more enjoyable.

### How to get the most out of the live notification feature

1. Go to the Integrations page inside the getty dashboard.
2. Select Discord or Telegram and paste the corresponding webhook or token.
3. Design your message:

- Title: something catchy like "ðŸš€ Our stream is LIVE!"
- Description: a brief summary of the content or invitation to join.
- Thumbnail: the stream cover taken from the Odysee post.
- Footer: useful links, hashtags, or acknowledgements.

4. Save the configuration.
5. When your channel switches to "live", the notification will be sent automatically. If you want to review it first, press the manual send button and verify everything looks perfect.

With this tool, the distance between your content and your audience shrinks to seconds. You no longer have to rely on late reminders or hope someone shares the link; getty does it for you.

Getty v1.0.8 isnâ€™t just a list of fixes and technical improvements; itâ€™s a statement of intent: we want your community always informed, your Odysee streams hitting maximum impact, and you focused on creating content while we handle notification logistics.

Integration with Discord and Telegram is the perfect example of how the platform evolves to adapt to modern workflows and the need for instant communication.

::: important

Oh, in case we hadnâ€™t mentioned it yet: the Integrations page also includes webhook setup for tip notifications to Discord and Telegram. If someone sends tips or hyperchats to your Odysee wallet, a notification will also be sent to Discord or Telegram.

:::

So if you havenâ€™t tried the new feature yet, we invite you to test it right now. Configure your message, save the changes, and get ready to watch your followers show up in force the moment you hit "go live".

The era of late alerts is over; with getty v1.0.8, the excitement comes instantly.

## ==λ v1.1.0:== By the power of Grayskull!

Introducing getty v1.1.0, a surprise update packed with new features, fixes, and great usability improvements. Take a look at everything that’s new.

### Achievement system for live streams

Starting with this version, streamers can receive unlocked achievement notifications that trigger automatically when the audience meets certain criteria in your Odysee livestreams. Achievements appear both on the OBS screen and on getty’s main page.

### How does the achievement system work?

From the achievements page in getty’s admin area you can watch in real time as achievements are completed while your Odysee stream evolves. For example: unlock achievements with your first 5 viewers, a streak of 20 average viewers, 100 messages in one stream, 50 people chatting simultaneously, your first received tip, and many other available milestones.

Make sure the configuration is correct. Check whether a feature requires the ClaimID of your channel or the ClaimID of your live stream post. A ClaimID is a unique identifier for a channel or a piece of content.

### Sounds and volume control

- **Preview:** Adjust the volume level and listen to a preview before saving the configuration. If you want to use a custom audio file, upload your own.
- **Reset options:** Some achievements can be reset after completion or reaching 100%. Others intentionally cannot be reset to keep the experience a challenge.
- **Widget position for OBS:** Configure the position of the achievements widget from settings.
- **Do not disturb:** Hide achievement notifications while active. (Why would you do that?)

### New notifications page design

The redesigned notifications page includes a fully customizable GIF widget. You can upload any ==.gif file== and getty will automatically scale it to either reach the widget’s maximum height or fit the defined layout—always maintaining the correct aspect ratio.

The GIF is positioned according to the settings you assign, keeping visual content aligned and out of the way of other information. The interface also includes advanced options like ==text‑to‑speech (TTS)== —enable or disable for tip notifications—, TTS language selection, and the optional ability to read every chat message.

For audio you can choose between a remote default sound or upload a custom file whose volume level is controlled via a slider (e.g., 85%). All of this is directly integrated with OBS, and the widget generates a unique URL you can embed wherever needed, delivering a more dynamic, accessible, and adaptable notification experience for every streamer.

The v1.1.0 update transforms how you interact with your audience. Achievements are now more engaging, customizable, and easy to integrate into your streams, while the new design and sound control make every notification a memorable moment.

## ==λ v1.0.2:== Widget and Configuration Improvements

We've implemented several improvements and fixes to optimize your experience!

### New Widget: Livestream Viewers

You can now display the number of viewers in real time with the new 'liveviews' widget, which includes:

1. Visual customization (background, color, font, size, icon) via CSS/backend.
2. Automatic viewer/status synchronization (API + WebSocket).
3. Multiple language support (i18n).
4. Dynamic icon loading with validation.
5. Admin panel integration for configuration.

## Optimizations and Fixes

### Tip Goal Widget:

1. Persistent and modular configuration (no data duplication).
2. The frontend (admin) now correctly displays saved values.
3. Elimination of unnecessary logs and clearer error messages.
4. No need for the .env file anymore! Everything is loaded from the admin/server.

### General Improvements:

1. Improved real-time data integration.
2. Full i18n support in widgets and frontend.
3. Persistent label customization (e.g., "viewers").
4. UI/UX validations: color pickers, styles, icons.
5. More robust error and message handling in the frontend.

**These changes make configuration more intuitive and stable.**

Version: 1.0

**Effective Date: 2025-09-05**

## 1. Nature of the Project

Getty is open‑source software (MIT license). You can run it self‑hosted or use a hosted instance operated by third parties. These Terms govern use of the application and complement the Privacy Policy ([see Privacy Policy](/en/guide/privacypolicy/)).

## 2. Acceptance

By using Getty (in any mode) you fully accept these Terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the hosted instance and/or stop running the software.

## 3. License and Open Source

The code is distributed under MIT: no warranties; use at your own risk. Nothing here limits or modifies the rights granted by the MIT license.

## 4. User Responsibility for Data

- You are solely responsible for the content, settings, tokens and keys you enter.
- Getty (repository maintainers) cannot access your local files, wallets, or the data you enter in a self‑hosted instance.
- In hosted mode, the operator only sees data strictly necessary for operation (minimal technical logs); they do not access the internal content of your configuration files unless you voluntarily share it for support.

## 5. Non‑Custodial / No Direct Access

Getty does not custody funds nor control your wallets; it only reads public or authorized data for display and goal calculation. It does not request or require private keys.

## 6. Third‑Party Integrations

When you enable integrations (Odysee, Discord, Telegram or others), you also accept the terms and policies of those platforms. Getty is not responsible for changes, downtime, rate limits, or data loss caused by external services.

## 7. Acceptable Use

You must not:

- Use Getty for illegal activity, fraud, phishing, or malware distribution.
- Attempt to compromise the security of other instances.
- Perform scraping or abuse that generates excessive load on third‑party APIs.
- Deliberately circumvent technical limitations.

## 8. Security

You are responsible for:

- Keeping your server/host updated (OS and dependency patches).
- Protecting tokens and config files (file permissions, optional at‑rest encryption).
- Using HTTPS when exposing a public instance.
  Maintainers do not guarantee absence of vulnerabilities; review and update periodically.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

Getty is provided “as is” without express or implied warranties: merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, continuous availability, or error‑free operation.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, authors and contributors shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential damages, loss of profits, data or use, arising from or related to use or inability to use Getty.

## 11. Updates and Changes

These Terms may be updated by versioning this page. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. A version history will be maintained in source control.

## 12. Support and Contributions

Community support is offered with no obligation to respond. Issues and pull requests are moderated under good conduct practices. Inclusion of contributions is not guaranteed.

## 13. Legal and Tax Compliance

You are responsible for any tax or regulatory obligations arising from tips, donations, or other flows displayed through Getty.

## 14. Termination

You may stop using the software at any time. The operator of a hosted instance may suspend access for violations of these Terms.

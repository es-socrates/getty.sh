## Last Tip ðŸŒŸ

Show the last tip received on your livestream with style and in real time. This widget integrates seamlessly with AR (Arweave) tokens from your Odysee wallet, enabling secure and decentralized tips. **Customize it as you like:** adjust colors, size, and font to match your channel's aesthetic.

==The best part?== It works without relying on centralized servers, ensuring greater privacy and availability.

## Tip Notification ðŸ””

Add a unique touch to your stream with visual notifications every time you receive a tip. It supports AR (Arweave) tokens and **anonymous tips**, facilitating transactions without intermediaries.

## HyperChat Notification + Text-to-Speech ðŸŽ¤ 

Take audience engagement to the next level! This widget not only displays visual notifications when you receive a HyperChat or tip from the Odysee chat, but also includes a **text-to-speech (TTS)** option so messages are read aloud on your stream. Ideal for not missing any important comments, even if you're focused on the game or content.

All powered by Odysee and AR (Arweave) tokens for secure, decentralized transactions. Customize animations, colors, fonts, and even the TTS voice to make everything fit your style. Being a decentralized widget, you avoid external server issues, ensuring fluidity and complete autonomy.

==Text-to-speech (TTS) works with your operating system's voice package==

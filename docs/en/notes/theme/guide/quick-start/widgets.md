## Last Tip ðŸŒŸ

Show the last tip received on your live stream with style and in real time. This widget integrates seamlessly with AR (Arweave) tokens from your Odysee wallet, enabling secure and decentralized tips. **Customize it as you like:** adjust colors, size, and font to match your channel's aesthetic.

==The best part?== It works without relying on centralized servers, ensuring greater privacy and availability.

## Tip Notification ðŸ””

Add a unique touch to your stream with visual notifications every time you receive a tip. It supports AR (Arweave) tokens and **anonymous tips**, facilitating transactions without intermediaries. Customize its design with different colors, and fonts to reflect your brand. As a decentralized widget, you avoid external server outages and offer a more fluid experience to your audience.

## HyperChat Notification + Text-to-Speech ðŸŽ¤

Take audience engagement to the next level! This widget not only displays visual notifications when you receive a HyperChat or tip from the Odysee chat, but also includes a **text-to-speech (TTS)** option so messages are read aloud on your stream. Ideal for not missing any important comments, even if you're focused on the game or content.

All powered by Odysee and AR (Arweave) tokens for secure, decentralized transactions. Customize animations, colors, fonts, and even the TTS voice to make everything fit your style. Being a decentralized widget, you avoid external server issues, ensuring fluidity and complete autonomy.

==Text-to-speech (TTS) works with your operating system's voice package==

## Live Stream Viewers ðŸ‘€

The Live Stream Viewers widget is an essential tool for ==Odysee streamers==, allowing them to display the number of viewers connected to their stream in real time. This widget not only helps engage with their audience, thanking them for their presence or encouraging participation when the number increases, but also serves as an instant metric for adjusting content based on audience reaction.

Many creators integrate it into their overlays to maintain constant feedback, generating engagement and adapting their streams based on their active audience. It can also be a key indicator for detecting peaks in interest or key moments during the live stream, thus optimizing their streaming strategy.

## Command-Based Giveaway System ðŸŽ‰

Create exciting giveaways directly from the chat with this interactive widget. Participants can join using commands, and everything is managed transparently and decentrally. Customize messages, colors, and prizes to make it more attractive. By not relying on third parties, you ensure impartiality and greater trust in your dynamics.

::: warning

Giveaways in the chat or live stream are 100% managed by the channel owner and not by Getty or Odysee.

## Social Media Widget ðŸ“±

The social media widget is an essential tool for Odysee streamers who want to maintain a constant connection with their audience beyond their streams. These overlays allow streamers to customize and display links to the streamer's social media accounts on OBS, such as Discord, Telegram, X, and other platforms, directly within their live stream.

Streamers can configure the social media widget from Getty in the admin, customizing usernames, icons, and links. This not only makes it easier for viewers to follow the streamer on different platforms, but also improves interaction and engagement during the stream.

## Real-time announcements

A dynamic widget that allows you to display fully customizable announcements during your live streams. From the admin panel, users can design and schedule custom bannersâ€”changing the text, images, colors, and display timesâ€”to suit the style and audience of each stream. The widget automatically syncs with the app, updating content in real time without the need to restart the broadcast, ensuring a smooth and professional visual experience while instantly promoting products, events, or key messages.

## Advantages of Decentralization ðŸš€

These widgets are powered by decentralized backend technology ==(Arweave and Odysee)==, resulting in greater security, privacy, and availability. Without centralized servers that can crash or be censored, you and your community enjoy a more free and reliable experience. Plus, advanced customization allows you to maintain a consistent brand identity across all your streams.

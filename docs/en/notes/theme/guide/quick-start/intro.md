Odysee is a [blockchain‑based media platform](https://odysee.com/). It hosts all kinds of media—images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc.—but is best known for video. Odysee aims to bring back the early‑2000s open internet spirit. Instead of boosting corporate late‑night shows, TV brands, or newsroom content, Odysee is a place for everyone, especially independent creators.

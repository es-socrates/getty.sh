Among the most visible adjustments are minor fixes to chat themes, the view counter, and ads, which now run more smoothly and without interruptions. Furthermore, the CSS styles for chat themes have been optimized, resulting in a cleaner and more consistent appearance, and enhancements have been added for administrators, making it easier to manage widgets and other settings.</p><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Important</p><p>There is currently an online version that you can try out. However, this online version has limitations in terms of server capacity and synchronization speed, but it is an excellent gateway for you to get to know getty. If you want privacy and don&#39;t want to use cloud services, run getty locally.</p></div><p>Several usability issues have been resolved, such as the character limit on awards and button alignment, ensuring a more intuitive interaction. A significant advancement is the incorporation of a real-time metrics system, accompanied by interface improvements that allow users to visualize key data instantly. Alongside this, a new &quot;Tip Goal&quot; theme was launched, and the gateway to Arweave was improved, offering a more stable and secure integration with the decentralized network.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/72b81a6bea1e60356dcffc73ba58e5cd.webp" alt="getty"></p><p>To broaden accessibility, an optional Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature was added for all users, accompanied by minor fixes to fine-tune its operation. Regarding infrastructure, critical dependencies such as ESLint, Vue, and PurgeCSS were updated, which reinforces code quality and reduces potential vulnerabilities. Hosting tests were conducted, and URL cleanups were implemented in the widgets, ensuring that links are clearer and more secure.</p><p>Configuration and export settings were expanded, allowing for more flexible management of sessions and tokens. Security was strengthened by blocking unauthorized global broadcasts and hiding secrets when there is no active session. Additionally, the visibility of the wallet in local environments was corrected, and the coloring of chats on hosts was standardized, improving visual consistency.</p><p>Improvements were introduced in server optimization and session-based data protection, including the enabling of CSP policies, WebSocket origin whitelists, and the slowing down of tip goal updates to prevent overloads. The user interface logic was extracted into dedicated modules, simplifying front-end maintenance and evolution.</p><p>In the realm of security, data was isolated per session, the wallet was validated, and tokenization measures were applied to protect sensitive information. Widgets now generate tokenized URLs, and the admin panel has additional protections against unwanted access. Furthermore, the raffle was synchronized, and the initial tip goal was configured, offering a more structured experience for live community events.</p><p>Finally, new features were added, such as live stream history or statistics from the admin panel, a brand renewal and partial migrations to Arweave, and finally, version 1.0.7 of getty (λ) was launched, which incorporates performance improvements and minor bug fixes.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/8812c1f415b7e9693ee5f5e63f9f3ca6.webp" alt="getty"></p><p>All these updates reflect the team&#39;s ongoing commitment to delivering a more robust, secure, and enjoyable platform for the community.</p><h3 id="λ" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#λ"><span><strong>λ</strong></span></a></h3>',13)])])}const d=t(o,[["render",r]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/blog/update.1.0.7/","title":"getty v1.0.7","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"getty v1.0.7","date":"2025-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","permalink":"/en/blog/update.1.0.7/","createTime":"2025/08/29 17:30","cover":"https://thumbs.odycdn.com/437709ea7abb8670a1911eacb3522e5a.webp","coverStyle":{"layout":"left","width":200,"compact":true},"description":"λ v1.0.7: Improvements and new features Over the past few weeks, the getty experience has been intensively improved, and its security has been reinforced.

With the integration of <strong><a href="https://www.wander.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wander</a></strong>, streamers on <strong><a href="https://odysee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odysee</a></strong> can turn every moment —going live, receiving hyperchats, or tips— into a unique experience.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/2190a0f2f6e0caa96e3ea266a8e494f3.webp" alt="wander"></p><h2 id="discover-what-s-new-in-getty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discover-what-s-new-in-getty"><span>Discover what’s new in getty</span></a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Wander integration:</strong> Sign in to getty using your Wander. Forget complicated passwords and manage your identity directly from the blockwave. Authentication is secure, fast, and—best of all—works on any device. Wander is a native, non‑custodial wallet for Arweave and AO. It’s available as a browser extension, mobile app, and embedded wallet SDK.</p></li><li><p><strong>New achievements system:</strong> An update that gamifies the experience for streamers and their communities. Each time you hit key milestones—such as accumulating streaming hours, reaching a certain number of chat messages, completing special events, or surpassing tip goals—you’ll unlock visual achievements displayed on your profile and on your live stream overlay.</p></li></ol><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Important</p><p>Make sure your configuration is correct. This feature requires your channel’s ClaimID, not the ClaimID of your live stream post. A ClaimID is a unique identifier for a channel or a piece of content.</p></div><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/41d30868817717a8c38b04f7934893eb.webp" alt="getty"></p><p>These achievements not only serve as public recognition of growth and dedication, they’re also a way to track the evolution of your live streams—encouraging streamers to keep a steady production and audiences to participate actively in the challenges presented.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Announcements refactor:</strong> Announcements now appear in a single horizontal banner, with a unified UI that doesn’t interrupt your creative flow. Configure your announcements to show custom messages to your live audience. Create static or rotating banners as you prefer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Live stream history:</strong> Inflated hours were removed and consistent metrics are guaranteed across different time zones. Configure your stream history, trends, and activity. Quickly enable or disable what you need to see in the admin panel.</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/fc76333a44f47cfcbaa81c31191bd9e3.webp" alt="getty"></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Session isolation and data encryption:</strong> Greater privacy and security for every user. Your sessions create a token that works like a username; these tokens are reset each time you sign in with Wander. Your settings aren’t readable—they’re encrypted and isolated. In addition, each widget includes a unique identification token to ensure your overlays in OBS work correctly.</li></ol><h3 id="benefits-for-odysee-streamers-and-creators" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-for-odysee-streamers-and-creators"><span>Benefits for Odysee streamers and creators</span></a></h3><p><strong>With Wander Wallet integrated into getty, streamers on Odysee can:</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>What happens</th><th>Benefit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Upload content</td><td>Connect your Wander Wallet on Odysee and receive payments in AR (Arweave).</td><td>Monetize every video with no intermediaries.</td></tr><tr><td>Go live</td><td>When you start a stream, the wallet is ready to receive hyperchats and tips.</td><td>Instant earnings while you interact.</td></tr><tr><td>Receive tips</td><td>Viewers can send tips directly to the same wallet used for login.</td><td>A unified, frictionless payment flow.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>The chat settings page has been completely revamped.
